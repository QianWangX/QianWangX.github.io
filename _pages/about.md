Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

I'm currently a master student from KAUST and I'm supervised by [Prof.Peter Wonka](https://peterwonka.net/). I'm interested in applying generative models to some applications. I will continue phd in KAUST. Before I obtained my bachelor degree in Wuhan University, China.
